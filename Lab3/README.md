The instructions you should use for demo are given in "Lab3_testcase.s". For your convenience, the machine codes are also given in "Lab3_testcase.txt".

When you show your demo, you need to output:

```
time:
ra =
t0 =
t1 =
t2 =
t3 =
t4 =
```

just like your lab2 demo. For instance, if your demo works well, the final output of it should be:

```
time: (the current time period)
ra = 0x000000fc
t0 = 0xffcd8000
t1 = 0x00000c98
t2 = 0x00000000
t3 = 0x00000002
t4 = 0x00000098
```
